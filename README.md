# IntroductionToSoftwareEngineering

This subject provides an introduction to the ideas and skills foundational to software engineering and will cover the fundamental concepts of programming with a particular focus on learning to use the C++ programming language. Students will gain an understanding of the basic ideas underlying programming and experience developing applications using an integrated development environment (IDE).

# Introducing C++
C++ is leveraged by millions of programmers around the world. It ’ s one of the most popular languages for writing computer applications — and the most popular language for writing big-budget computer games.

## What Is C++ Used For?

###1) Games
C++ is close to the hardware, can easily manipulate resources, provide procedural programming over CPU intensive functions and is fast. It is also able to override the complexities of 3D games and provides multilayer networking. All these benefits of C++ make it a primary choice to develop the gaming systems as well as game development suites

###2) GUI Based Applications
C++ can be used to develop most of the GUI based and desktop applications easily as it has got the required features.

Most of the applications of the adobe systems including Illustrator, Photoshop, etc. are developed using C++.
## Creating an Executable File

The file that you run to launch a program — whether you ’ re talking about a game or a business application — is an executable file . There are several steps to creating an executable file from C++ source code (a collection of instructions in the C++ language). The process is illustrated in

1. First, the programmer uses an editor to write the C++ source code, a file that usually has the extension .cpp . The editor is like a word processor for programs; it allows a programmer to create, edit, and save source code.
2. After the programmer saves a source file, he or she invokes a C++ compiler — an application that reads source code and translates it into an object file . Object files usually have the extension .obj .
3. Next, a linker links the object file to any external files as necessary, and then creates the executable file, which generally ends with the extension .exe . At this point, a user (or gamer) can run the program by launching the executable file.

To help automate this process, it ’ s common for a programmer to use an all-in-one tool for development, called an `IDE ( Integrated Development Environment )`. An IDE typically combines an editor, a compiler, and a linker, along with other tools.

## Dealing with Errors
- **Compile errors**. These occur during code compilation. As a result, an object file is not produced. These can be syntax errors , meaning that the compiler doesn ’ t understand something. They ’ re often caused by something as simple as a typo. Compilers can issue warnings, too. Although you usually don ’ t need to heed the warnings, you should treat them as errors, fix them, and recompile.


- **Link errors**. These occur during the linking process and may indicate that something the program references externally can ’ t be found. These errors are usually solved by adjusting the offending reference and starting the compile/link process again.


- **Run-time errors**. These occur when the executable is run. If the program does something illegal, it can crash abruptly. But a more subtle form of run-time error, a logical error , can make the program simply behave in unintended ways. If you ’ ve ever played a game where a character walked on air (that is, a character who shouldn ’ t be able to walk on air), then you ’ ve seen a logical error in action.

# Introduction to Replit

Replit is a coding platform that lets you write code and host apps. It also has many educational features built-in, making it great for teachers and learners too.

## Learning Code: Replit for Students
If you're learning to code, whether as a self-taught programmer or as part of another course, you'll find our learning resources useful.

You can work through our [project-based tutorials](https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/00-overview) to learn how to code, or download them all as an [ebook](https://www.codewithreplit.com/).

If you're learning a specific language, we probably cover it in one of our teacher-contributed [open curricula](https://docs.replit.com/teaching-curriculum/intro-teaching-curriculum).

We also have a beginner-friendly [Discord server](https://discord.util.repl.co/join) where you can get (and give) help on nearly anything.
