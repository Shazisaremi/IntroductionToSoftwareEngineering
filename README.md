Replit is a coding platform that lets you write code and host apps. It also has many educational features built-in, making it great for teachers and learners too.

## Learning Code: Replit for Students
If you're learning to code, whether as a self-taught programmer or as part of another course, you'll find our learning resources useful.

You can work through our [project-based tutorials](https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/00-overview) to learn how to code, or download them all as an [ebook](https://www.codewithreplit.com/).

If you're learning a specific language, we probably cover it in one of our teacher-contributed [open curricula](https://docs.replit.com/teaching-curriculum/intro-teaching-curriculum).

We also have a beginner-friendly [Discord server](https://discord.util.repl.co/join) where you can get (and give) help on nearly anything.
