## Introduction to Sum of Positive Numbers

In this program, the user is prompted to enter a number, which is stored in the variable `number`.

In order to store the sum of the numbers, we declare a variable `sum` and initialize it to the value of `0`.

The `while` loop continues until the user enters a negative number. During each iteration, the number entered by the user is added to the `sum` variable.

When the user enters a negative number, the loop terminates. Finally, the total sum is displayed.
