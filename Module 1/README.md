# 1. Introducing ISE102 and Programming

Answering the question “what is programming?” and making our first programs.

## First Steps

### 1. Bookmark these notes!

You’ll use them every week during class, homework, revision, assignment work. You can click on ISE102 in the breadcrumb list above or bookmark this link: [https://torrens.page.link/ISE102](https://torrens.page.link/ISE102)

### 2. Confirm you’ve signed up with the required services.

As covered in the announcements yesterday on Blackboard and in Discord, you need to have created accounts on the following services using your university email address:

1. Github (and applied for student pack)
2. Replit (with that Github account)
3. Notion

### 3. Introduce yourself in Discord

Let’s jump on Discord Join the Torrens class discord server if you haven’t already. I’ll be making announcements there but we’ll be using the subject channels to post our work during class, ask questions when we get stuck, etc. *(PS - don’t show your code in the channel, just screenshots)*

### **Quick intros**

Introduce yourself in our #in-class-ise102 channel.

1. Name
2. Degree you’re doing here
3. Uni, school or job you went to before taking this course
4. Favourite game ever and favourite current game. Include platform you played it on (Switch, XBone, PS5, PC, phone etc)
5. Have you ever programmed or scripted before? Python, javascript, scratch, maybe even html? Was it for yourself or at work? Did you get far?
6. Have you ever opened up your computer and changed/added parts? Have you ever built your own pc from parts?

### Class vs Blackboard and Notes

For each module of each subject, Blackboard holds plenty of helpful information, resources and links to further learning. The information and resources amount to a summary and a guide, **but they do not cover everything you will learn in this course.** You cannot simply work from Blackboard’s pre set content alone to pass the subject.

**Critical learning and information** **are included in the classes/streams and in communication from your lecturer.** You must watch each week’s lectures and other recordings provided by your facilitator, and keep up with communications via your **uni email** (eg sally.chen@mds.torrens.edu.au), Blackboard subject **announcements** and **messages**, and the subject Discord channels.

## Software Engineering

To do *software engineering*, first you need to be able to **program a computer**! That means telling it to display things, add numbers, make basic decisions and so on. Once you have the basics of telling it what to do, then you start building bigger programs that are a lot more useful/fun; at that stage you’ll begin doing **software engineering**.

**Programming is just recipes**

First, good news. Programming is something you have been doing your whole life, it’s just that for many of you it’s not on computers. For those people, programming might sound a bit offputting because it evokes the idea of computers and code and zeros and ones; but that’s just the details at the end of the process, the execution.

What you’ll learn in this class is that **programming is something much more basic:** *it’s **a recipe for completing a task**.*

> 💡 **Chefs Program People** 
>
> If a pastry chef writes down a recipe for her chocolate ganache, she’s writing a program that enables another human to do one specific task: reproduce her tasty dessert. Again: A program is just a recipe for completing a task.

## Task 

Here is a task to participate in and solve for the next week, [Module 1](https://replit.com/teams/join/nwwpztqgjgyjzklgfandtxqwxayfxihd-software-engineering-team
